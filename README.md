# BellyButton Biodiversity: Question is who lives in here?
Module 13 work 

## Overview
### Purpose of the project
The idea of this project is that someone wants to find a substitue for people eating beef and for some reason this person wants to use peoples' belly button orgnaisms for this purpose.  Also since the leader of this project wants to entice people to volunteer to provide samples of their belly button micro organisms, we need to create an interesting data fill website they can interact with. 

### Why I had some fun with it
I had to laugh about the entire concept of both looking at peoples' belly button contents plus why anyone would think this concept could be used to grow 'meat' tasting or meat looking proteins that people would agrree to eat. I would say that any new idea might have a chance to work, but one should really have some advanced marketing studies at least before getting volunteers to donate their belly button contents. I mean, what about earwax? I grow plenty of that and while I don't know if any bacteria live in there, it is likely that something useful does.

## Website
### Tools used
For the Interactive Dashboard created in this project, I used PyCharm to edit the HTML document, create a small CSS file and to add major code to the JavaScript file charts.js in a project. Because I am using Windoze 10, I used the git bash terminal app to start the Python based web server on port 8000. This only worked when I navigated to the folder where my website's files are found. Then I return to my PyCharm project, open the HTML file index.html using Chrome, and I see the interactive website.

### How things look and work
Here is what the top of the website and its little icon (BB on blue) look like:

## Summary

### Funny
I cannot imagine excavating anyone's belly button, even mine
### Meat
I love steak and don't eat bugs or other weird stuff: one of my mottos is: no tentagiggles, eyeballs or intestines
